# CS230_Project_2023

I will write here what files I have added and where they have been placed.
- There are the files for the replacement policies other than lru, they have been placed in the 'replacement' folder (eg. fifo.llc_repl).
- There is also a file from lab5 in 'prefetcher' folder: BO.l2c_pref
- Lastly, there are the extra cache files for inclusive, exclusive, and non-inclusive in 'src' folder. If we want to run champsim, we can just rename any of the three files to cache.cc, take the other three files out of src folder and run it.
